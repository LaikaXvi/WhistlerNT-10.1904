# WhistlerNT-10.1904
Whistler Theme For Windows 10.

This is a repo for me to keep track of all the shit ive done and to (eventually) be able to reliably recreate these customizations for publication purposes.

So far Ive:

Learned ResourceHacker, to pull Shell32.dll Icons from whistler build 2410, probably the most "complete" of the whistler 2000 watercolor builds.

All of my customizations were made on Windows 10 LTSC 21h2, Build 19044.3031
