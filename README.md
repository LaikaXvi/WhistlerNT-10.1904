# WhistlerNT-10.1904
Whistler Theme For Windows 10.

This is a repo for me to keep track of all the shit ive done and to (eventually) be able to reliably recreate these customizations for publication purposes.

So far Ive:

Learned ResourceHacker, to pull Shell32.dll Icons from whistler build 2410, probably the most "complete" of the whistler 2000 watercolor builds.
Ive learned Paint.NET, and a few other Image manipulation softwares, and how windows handles images, and Icons.
Ive learned a lot about Windows Window border composition, how themes work and how they're applied through windows in different ways.
Ive spent 2 days making custom shutdown, logout, and restart Icons to match whistler's start menu Icons because the ones I pulled from the actual version weren't high resolution enough to work on modern windows.. SO I had to make my own. 

# Whats done?
Window Border/VisualStyle/MSStyle and Explorer theme.
Taskbar
Start menu

# In Progress:
ClassicLogonShell theme.
